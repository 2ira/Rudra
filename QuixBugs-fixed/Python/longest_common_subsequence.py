The original approach was correct in its recursive strategy but inefficient and incorrect due to not properly handling the case when characters at the current positions of \(a\) and \(b\) match. Instead of only progressing through \(a\), it should progress through both \(a\) and \(b\) as they share a common character. This fix implements a dynamic programming approach, using a 2D array (dp) to store the longest common subsequences for substrings of \(a\) and \(b\) up to lengths \(i\) and \(j\), respectively. This eliminates the redundancy and errors of the original recursion by systematically building up solutions for progressively larger substrings, ensuring the correct subsequence is found even when multiple common subsequences of the same length exist.
