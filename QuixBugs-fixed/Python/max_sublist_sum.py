The original code did not correctly handle negative numbers in the sequence. This is because the max\_ending\_here variable was allowed to accumulate negative values without any mechanism to reset it to zero when its value would be less beneficial than starting a new subsequence (thus potentially ignoring higher sums that start after a negative total sum). By adding a max(0, ...) around the update of max\_ending\_here, we ensure that if the accumulated sum becomes negative, it's reset to 0, effectively starting a new subsequence. This change ensures the function correctly computes the maximum sum of any subsequence by not carrying over negative sums that would reduce the overall maximum sum found. Tracking the key parameter values, max\_ending\_here and max\_so\_far, through each iteration of the loop and applying this reset logic, aligns the function's behavior with the requirement to find the maximum sum of any subarray, including handling arrays that consist of both positive and negative numbers.
