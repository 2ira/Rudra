The faulty line in the given code was the condition in the while loop: `while abs(x - approx) > epsilon`. This line is incorrect because it compares the input \(x\) directly with the approximation (`approx`) instead of comparing the square of the approximation (`approx^2`) with \(x\). The correct method to check if we have reached a good enough approximation of the square root is to check if the square of our current guess (approximation) is close enough to the input \(x\), which means the absolute difference between `approx^2` and \(x\) should be less than or equal to `epsilon`. Therefore, the corrected condition is `while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon`. This ensures that the loop continues to refine the approximation until it is within the epsilon range of the actual square root of \(x\). Tracking the key parameter values, such as the approximation (`approx`) and how its square compares to \(x\), guides the revision by focusing on the correct mathematical relationship for finding square roots via the Newton-Raphson method.
