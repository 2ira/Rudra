def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x  # corrected line
'''
The original faulty line attempted to recursively call flatten on non-list items and yield the result, which does not make sense since non-list items do not need further flattening. By tracking the parameter values, it's clear that when a non-list item is encountered (like integers or strings), it should be yielded directly to the generator instead of attempting further flattening. The correction thus involves changing the faulty line to simply yield \(x\) when it's not a list, aligning with the behavior expected from the examples and test cases provided.
