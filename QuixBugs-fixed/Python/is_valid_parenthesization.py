'''
The original code fails to handle the case where there are more opening parentheses than closing parentheses, which results in a non-zero depth at the end of the string iteration. By ensuring that the depth equals 0 at the end of the loop, we guarantee that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, hence a properly nested parenthesization. The critical parameter to track here is \textit{depth}. Initially, \textit{depth} is set to 0, and it increments or decrements based on whether an opening or closing parenthesis is encountered. The faulty code did not account for the scenario where there are unmatched opening parentheses (i.e., when \textit{depth} > 0 after processing the entire string), which is addressed by the condition \textit{return depth == 0}.
