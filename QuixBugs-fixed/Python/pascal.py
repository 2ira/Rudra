Initially, the faulty code tries to construct each row of Pascal's triangle but fails to correctly implement the logic for calculating the values between the first and last elements of each row. By analyzing the expected outcomes, it's clear that each row starts and ends with 1, and each value between is the sum of two values from the previous row directly above it. The original code does not append 1 at the beginning and end of each row (except for the first row) and incorrectly attempts to calculate the sum of 'upleft' and 'upright' without ensuring that the current cell is properly bounded. The solution involves initializing each row with a leading 1, iterating through the indices from 1 to r to calculate the middle values by summing the appropriate pairs from the previous row, and finally appending 1 to the end of the row to maintain the structure of Pascal's triangle. By tracking the construction of each row, especially focusing on how the sums of the elements from the previous row are used, we correct the faulty logic and ensure the output matches the expected Pascal's triangle structure.
