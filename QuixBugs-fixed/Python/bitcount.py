The original code uses the XOR operation (\text{\^{}=}) on the variable \textit{n} with \textit{n-1}, which is incorrect for the purpose of counting bits set to 1. The correct operation to use in this context is AND (&=), which effectively removes the lowest set bit from \textit{n} in each iteration of the loop. This is because \textit{n \& (n-1)} sets the least significant bit that is 1 to 0 and keeps the other bits the same, which precisely serves our need to count the number of 1-bits. By tracking the parameter value \textit{n} through each iteration, we can see that this change correctly reduces \textit{n} by turning off the rightmost 1-bit until \textit{n} becomes 0, correctly incrementing \textit{count} by 1 for each 1-bit found.
