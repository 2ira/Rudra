'''
The key parameter values to track were the operands \(a\) and \(b\) that are popped from the stack when an operator is encountered. In Reverse Polish Notation, the operator follows the operands, so when an operator is encountered, the last two operands in the stack (which are the most recently added) are the ones to be used. The original code incorrectly popped \(a\) before \(b\), reversing their intended order for the operation. By correcting the order of popping (\(b\) then \(a\)), the operands are now correctly aligned with their respective operators, ensuring the mathematical operations are conducted in the correct order, thus fixing the faulty behavior observed in the failed test cases.
