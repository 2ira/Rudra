'''
The primary issue with the original code was in its base case check and the way it handled the merging of the leftover elements from either left or right sub-arrays. Specifically, the faulty base case check \texttt{if len(arr) == 0} failed to correctly handle arrays with a single element, as it would not return until the array was empty, which is incorrect for merge sort's functioning. The correct base case should return the array itself when its length is less than or equal to 1, ensuring that the recursion begins to unwind correctly. Additionally, the way the leftover elements were extended into the result list was corrected by splitting the \texttt{result.extend(left[i:] or right[j:])} into two separate lines. This guarantees that all remaining elements from both the left and right sub-arrays are correctly appended to the result list, addressing issues where the previous logic could fail if both sub-arrays had remaining elements. Tracking the flow of an example input through the corrected code confirms that these adjustments enable the function to correctly sort the input array by following the merge sort algorithm's intended behavior.
