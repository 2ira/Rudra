The primary issue with the original code was in the line labeled as buggy. When the first characters of both strings matched, the function erroneously added 1 to the recursive call, implying an edit was made, which was incorrect for equal characters. The correct behavior, as fixed, does not increment the distance count when the first characters of both strings match. Instead, it simply proceeds to check the remainder of both strings, as they are one step closer to being identical without any edits. This fix ensures the function correctly calculates the Levenshtein distance by only incrementing the edit distance when characters do not match, leading to the function passing all given test cases.
