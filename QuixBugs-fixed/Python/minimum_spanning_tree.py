'''
The initial code attempted to manage the connectivity of the vertices through a dictionary that was supposed to map each vertex to its corresponding group (or connected component). However, the implementation was flawed because it directly tried to update the groups by merging dictionaries, which does not correctly handle the dynamic nature of union-find operations required for Kruskal's algorithm. The code was repaired by introducing two helper functions: \textit{find} and \textit{union}. 

The \textit{find} function recursively finds the root of a given node, ensuring that we always work with the highest parent in the hierarchy, which represents the set to which the node belongs. The \textit{union} function merges two sets by linking one root to another, effectively combining two distinct components into one. This approach correctly manages the merging of components as edges are added to the minimum spanning tree (MST), ensuring that cycles are not formed. 

The main function, \textit{minimum\_spanning\_tree}, was modified to initialize \textit{group\_by\_node} with each node as its own parent, reflecting a proper disjoint-set forest at the start. The sorting of edges by their weight was kept, but the union-find data structure was utilized to check if adding an edge would form a cycle (by checking if the nodes of the edge are in the same set). If not, the edge is added to the MST, and the sets are merged using the \textit{union} function. 

This corrected implementation of Kruskal's algorithm now correctly identifies the minimum spanning tree of a given graph by efficiently managing the connectivity of the graph's vertices through union-find operations.
