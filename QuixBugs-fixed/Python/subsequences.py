The primary issue was with the base case handling when \(k = 0\). Rather than returning an empty list \([]\), it should return a list containing an empty list \([[]]\) to correctly signal that a valid sequence of length 0 (the base case) has been found. This change enables the correct concatenation of numbers to form subsequences. By analyzing parameter values, especially focusing on this base case, we see that for a subsequence of length \(k\), starting with \(k = 0\) and building up, an empty sequence acts as the foundation that we build upon. This insight led to the correction.
