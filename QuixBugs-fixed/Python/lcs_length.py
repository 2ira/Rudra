'''
The original code incorrectly attempted to store the length of the longest common substring (LCS) using a Counter, which is not suitable for this problem. The mistake was in trying to increment dp[i, j] based on the previous state dp[i-1, j], which does not correctly track the length of the LCS. It should track the continuation of matching characters (i.e., dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if s[i-1] == t[j-1]). The revised code uses a 2D list for dynamic programming (DP) to correctly track the lengths of common substrings ending at each pair of indices in the input strings. It initializes a matrix dp with zeros, where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS ending at s[i-1] and t[j-1]. It updates this matrix when characters match and keeps track of the maximum length found. This approach correctly solves the problem, as demonstrated by passing the provided test cases.
