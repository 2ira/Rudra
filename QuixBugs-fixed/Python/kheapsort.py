The initial code had two primary faults: 

1. The initial heap was created with only the first \(k\) elements of the array (\(arr[:k]\)), but it should be created with the first \(k+1\) elements (\(arr[:k+1]\)). This is because every element is at most \(k\) places away from its sorted position, so the correct element to start yielding could actually be \(k\) places ahead of the starting position, requiring \(k+1\) elements to ensure we have the correct starting element.

2. The for loop incorrectly iterated over the entire array again, including the elements already placed into the heap. This resulted in the heap containing and yielding incorrect elements. The correct behavior is to start adding and yielding elements from the array starting from index \(k+1\), as the first \(k+1\) elements are already in the heap and we proceed to process the rest of the array.

By adjusting the initial heap to contain \(k+1\) elements and correcting the iteration to start from the \(k+1\)th element, we ensure that the algorithm correctly processes elements that are at most \(k\) positions away from their sorted location, yielding a correctly sorted sequence as per the specifications.
