The original code had a logic bug in the condition that determined when to update the "ends" dictionary, which maps the length of the longest increasing subsequence to the index of its last element. By examining the failed cases and the code, it was identified that the condition for updating an entry in "ends" was flawed. The corrected line ensures that an update occurs not only when the current "length" equals "longest" or when the current value "val" is smaller than the last element of the current longest sequence, but also when there is no entry for "length + 1" in "ends". This fix ensures that we are correctly updating the entries for subsequences of all lengths, thereby accurately tracking the ends of the longest increasing subsequences found so far. This approach guarantees that the algorithm will correctly compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence by dynamically considering all possible subsequences up to the current iteration.
