'''
The original code had issues with handling cases where \(k\) indexed an element within the "above" list. The condition for recursion into the "above" list didn't adjust the \(k\) value to account for the elements in "below" and "middle" lists, which resulted in an infinite loop for some cases and incorrect outputs for others. The correct approach is to adjust \(k\) by subtracting the number of elements not greater (\(num\_lessoreq\)) when recursing into the "above" list, ensuring we're looking for the correct \(k-th\) element relative to the new sublist's ordering. This modification ensures the function correctly handles all cases by accurately narrowing down the search space and adjusting the \(k-th\) position accordingly.
