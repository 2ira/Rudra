The original algorithm attempted to handle the incrementation of digits and carry manually, which was error-prone, especially when multiple 9's are involved leading to incorrect behavior for cases like [9, 9, 9]. The revised solution converts the digit list to a number and increments it until a palindrome is found. This approach simplifies the logic, ensuring correctness for all inputs. The key parameters tracked were the palindrome check and conversion between number and list representations, guiding the revision towards a more straightforward and reliable solution.
