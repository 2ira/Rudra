The bug in the code was in the calculation of the shortest path within the nested for-loops, specifically in the line \texttt{length\_by\_path[i, j] = min(length\_by\_path[i, j], length\_by\_path[i, k] + length\_by\_path[j, k])}. The error was in the use of \texttt{length\_by\_path[j, k]} instead of the correct \texttt{length\_by\_path[k, j]} for calculating the shortest path. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm requires the update of the distance between two points \(i\) and \(j\) by considering a third point \(k\) and checking if a path from \(i\) to \(k\) and then \(k\) to \(j\) is shorter than the direct path from \(i\) to \(j\). The corrected line ensures the algorithm correctly updates the length of the path by using the correct indices to calculate the intermediary paths. The final change from \texttt{defaultdict} to \texttt{dict} in the return statement is to match the output format specified in the problem description, ensuring the function's output is exactly as per the requirements.
