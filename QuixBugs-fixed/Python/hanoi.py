The main issue was identified in the line where the move was being recorded incorrectly. Specifically, the move was logged as \text{(start, helper)} instead of the intended \text{(start, end)}. During the recursive calls, the algorithm is supposed to move a disk directly from the start peg to the end peg, not from the start peg to the helper peg as erroneously coded. This error led to the generation of incorrect steps in the solution sequence. By tracking the parameter values through recursive calls and comparing them with the expected outcomes, it became evident that each recursive call should culminate in a move directly affecting the end goal, hence the correction to \text{(start, end)}. This adjustment ensures that the steps recorded align with the actual moves required to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle correctly, yielding the expected sequences for all test cases provided.
