'''
The critical step in correcting the code involved identifying the incorrect conditional and operation on the suffix of the permutation list. By changing the condition from \texttt{perm[j] < perm[i]} to \texttt{perm[j] > perm[i]}, we ensure that we're finding the next greater element to swap with the element at index \textit{i}. Additionally, replacing \texttt{reversed(next\_perm[i + 1 :])} with \texttt{sorted(next\_perm[i + 1 :])} guarantees that the suffix of the list is in the least possible order, making the entire permutation the next lexicographically larger one. Tracking these parameter values against the expected outcomes indicated that these were the key fixes needed to correct the algorithm.
