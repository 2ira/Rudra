/* The main issue in the provided code was related to the binary search implementation which could lead to infinite recursion or incorrect behavior due to the incorrect handling of the search bounds. Specifically, the condition \texttt{if (start == end)} was changed to \texttt{if (start >= end)} to correctly handle the case when the search interval is empty, indicating that the value is not found in the array. Additionally, when the searched value \texttt{x} is greater than \texttt{arr[mid]}, the original code incorrectly set the next search interval's start as \texttt{mid} instead of \texttt{mid + 1}. This could potentially cause an infinite loop or recursion since the interval might not shrink as expected, especially when \texttt{x} is not present in the array. Adjusting this to \texttt{mid + 1} ensures that the search space is correctly narrowed down, preventing infinite recursion and ensuring that all cases, including the failed ones mentioned, are correctly handled.
