/* The original code failed because it did not correctly handle the case when \(n\) itself is prime or when \(n\) becomes prime in the recursive call, returning an empty list instead of including \(n\) itself. The faulty line was identified as the return statement that returned an empty list when it should have returned a list containing \(n\).

To fix this, I removed the recursion altogether and replaced it with a loop that divides \(n\) by each factor \(i\) (from \(2\) to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\)) as long as \(n\) is divisible by \(i\), adding \(i\) to the list of factors each time. After this loop, if \(n\) is greater than \(1\), it means \(n\) is a prime number greater than \(\sqrt{n}\) and should be added to the list of factors. This approach ensures that all prime factors, including repeated factors, are correctly identified and added to the list. The corrected code now passes all the failed test cases and meets the problem specifications.
