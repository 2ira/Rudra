/* The original code used the XOR operation \texttt{(n \^{} (n - 1))}, which is incorrect for counting the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of an integer. By analyzing the failed test cases and understanding how binary numbers work, it's clear that the intention was to repeatedly remove the rightmost 1-bit from the number until it becomes 0. The correct operation for this is \texttt{n = n \& (n - 1)}, which effectively removes the lowest-order bit that is set to 1 in every iteration of the loop, thereby counting all the 1-bits correctly. Tracking the value of \texttt{n} through each iteration of the loop with this corrected operation shows that it indeed counts the number of 1-bits accurately for all given test cases.
