/* The original code incorrectly calculated the Levenshtein distance due to the faulty base case and recursion logic. Specifically, it did not handle the scenario when the first characters of the source and target strings are the same correctly; it added 1 to the distance unnecessarily. Additionally, the approach did not use dynamic programming, leading to repeated computations and incorrect return values for all inputs.

The repaired code introduces a dynamic programming solution that correctly calculates the minimum number of edits required. The two-dimensional array \textit{dp} is used to store the Levenshtein distances between all prefixes of the source and target strings. For each pair of prefixes, the code calculates the cost based on whether the last characters are equal or not. This approach ensures the correct calculation of the distance while also significantly improving the performance by avoiding redundant calculations.

Tracking key parameter values, specifically the incremental build-up of the \textit{dp} array, guides the revisions by ensuring that at each step, the code correctly computes the minimum of the three possible edit actions (insert, delete, replace), leading to the correct final distance stored in \textit{dp[source.length()][target.length()]}.
