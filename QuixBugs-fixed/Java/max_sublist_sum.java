/* The original code had three main issues:
1. The initial value of \texttt{max\_so\_far} was set to 0, which is incorrect for arrays consisting entirely of negative numbers. It should be initialized to \texttt{Integer.MIN\_VALUE} to handle such cases correctly.
2. The update of \texttt{max\_ending\_here} did not properly account for scenarios where it would be more beneficial to start a new sublist at the current element rather than continuing with the previous sum. This was fixed by using \texttt{Math.max(x, max\_ending\_here + x)} to decide whether to start a new sublist or continue the existing one.
3. Finally, the original code did not explicitly handle the case where all elements are negative, leading to a situation where the maximum sum would be reported as a negative number. The final return statement was modified to return 0 if \texttt{max\_so\_far} is less than or equal to 0, ensuring compliance with the requirement that the empty sublist has a sum of 0.

Tracking the key parameter values, especially \texttt{max\_ending\_here} and \texttt{max\_so\_far}, through each iteration and comparing them with the expected outcomes revealed these issues. These fixes ensure that the code now correctly identifies the maximum sum sublist in various scenarios, including those with all negative numbers.
