/* The original code had several issues:
1. It incorrectly handled the swapping and reversing logic. Specifically, it attempted to create a reversed list in a buggy and unnecessary complex manner.
2. The condition to find the next larger element to swap was incorrect. It used a "<" instead of ">" comparison.
3. It mismanaged the creation and updating of the `next_perm` list, leading to incorrect or no updates at all.

By following the algorithm to find the next permutation correctly:
- First, traverse from the end to find the first pair where the previous element is less than the next (i < i+1).
- Then, traverse from the end again to find the first element larger than the found element and swap them.
- Finally, reverse the sublist after the position of the swapped element to get the next lexicographically larger permutation.

The repaired code now correctly implements these steps using `Collections.swap` for swapping and `Collections.reverse` for reversing the sublist, ensuring it meets all requirements and passes all test cases. Tracking the values of `i` for the first decreasing element and `j` for the element to swap with was key to identifying and fixing these issues.
