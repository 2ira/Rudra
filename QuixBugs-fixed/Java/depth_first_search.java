/* The main issue was the incorrect usage and understanding of how to import and use the Node class, and the method to access the successors of a node, which was assumed to be a method called getSuccessors(). I corrected these by removing the faulty import statement, assuming that Node is correctly defined elsewhere in the program context, and it contains a constructor and a method getSuccessors(). The code was also restructured for clarity and to ensure that nodesVisited properly tracks each node visited during the search, to avoid infinite loops in cycles within the graph. The use of equals() for node comparison ensures that the method works correctly even if Node overrides the equals method, which is common in Java for object comparisons.*/
