/* The main issues in the faulty code were: 
1. When \(k = 0\), the function did not return a list containing an empty list as expected. It incorrectly returned an uninitialized ArrayList without any elements inside. This was fixed by adding an empty list to the base case list when \(k = 0\). 
2. The for-loop condition was incorrect. It used \(i < b + 1 - k\), which did not properly iterate through the last elements that could form sequences of length \(k\). Changing this to \(i <= b - k\) ensures that all valid starting points for sequences of length \(k\) are considered.
3. The original code directly modified the 'rest' list by adding the element \(i\) at index 0. This approach was problematic because it could lead to unexpected behavior due to modifying the list while iterating. To fix this, a new list 'newSeq' is created for each subsequence, where \(i\) is added followed by the elements of 'rest', ensuring that the original lists are not modified unexpectedly.

By tracking the key parameter values and comparing them to expected outcomes, these revisions ensure the function correctly generates all increasing sequences of length \(k\) from the range \([a, b)\).
