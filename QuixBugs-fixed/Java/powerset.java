/* The key issue with the original code was how it handled recursion and the addition of elements to subsets. By removing an element and not correctly maintaining the original structure of the array for recursion, it failed to generate all possible subsets. The corrected version first removes the first element and stores it, ensuring the original list structure is maintained for the recursive call by passing a new ArrayList constructed from the rest of the original list. This approach allows for correctly generating all subsets, including those with and without the first element. Additionally, by adding subsets without the first element before creating new subsets that include the first element, we guarantee all possible combinations are covered. Tracking the flow of subsets through recursion and the iterative addition of the first element to each subset from the recursive call ensures that we systematically cover all combinations, resolving the fault and meeting the specified requirements.
