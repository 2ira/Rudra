There is an online game with N registered players. Today, which is the 10^{100}-th day since its launch, the developer Takahashi examined the users' login history.  It turned out that the i-th player logged in for B_i consecutive days from Day A_i, where Day 1 is the launch day, and did not log in for the other days. In other words, the i-th player logged in on Day A_i, A_i+1, \ldots, A_i+B_i-1, and only on those days. For each integer k such that 1\leq k\leq N, find the number of days on which exactly k players logged in. 
1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9 All values in input are integers.
