You are given an integer N.  Consider permuting the digits in N and separate them into two positive integers. For example, for the integer 123, there are six ways to separate it, as follows:12 and 3,21 and 3,13 and 2,31 and 2,23 and 1,32 and 1. Here, the two integers after separation must not contain leading zeros.  For example, it is not allowed to separate the integer 101 into 1 and 01.  Additionally, since the resulting integers must be positive, it is not allowed to separate 101 into 11 and 0, either. What is the maximum possible product of the two resulting integers, obtained by the optimal separation?
N is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). N contains two or more digits that are not 0.
