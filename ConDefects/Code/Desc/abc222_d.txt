A sequence of n numbers, S = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n), is said to be non-decreasing if and only if s_i \leq s_{i+1} holds for every i (1 \leq i \leq n - 1). Given are non-decreasing sequences of N integers each: A = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N) and B = (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_N). Consider a non-decreasing sequence of N integers, C = (c_1, c_2, \dots, c_N), that satisfies the following condition:a_i \leq c_i \leq b_i for every i (1 \leq i \leq N). Find the number, modulo 998244353, of sequences that can be C. 
1 \leq N \leq 3000 0 \leq a_i \leq b_i \leq 3000 (1 \leq i \leq N) The sequences A and B are non-decreasing. All values in input are integers.
