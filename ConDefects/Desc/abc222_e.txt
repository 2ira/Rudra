Given are a tree with N vertices, a sequence of M numbers A=(A_1,\ldots,A_M), and an integer K. The vertices are numbered 1 through N, and the i-th edge connects Vertices U_i and V_i. We will paint each of the N-1 edges of this tree red or blue.  Among the 2^{N-1} such ways, find the number of ones that satisfies the following condition, modulo 998244353. Condition:Let us put a piece on Vertex A_1, and for each i=1,\ldots,M-1 in this order, move it from Vertex A_i to Vertex A_{i+1} along the edges in the shortest path.  After all of these movements, R-B=K holds, where R and B are the numbers of times the piece traverses a red edge and a blue edge, respectively.
