Takahashi is playing with toy trains, connecting and disconnecting them. There are N toy train cars, with car numbers: Car 1, Car 2, \ldots, Car N. Initially, all cars are separated. You will be given Q queries.  Process them in the order they are given. There are three kinds of queries, as follows. 1 x y: Connect the front of Car y to the rear of Car x. It is guaranteed that:x \neq yjust before this query, no train is connected to the rear of Car x;just before this query, no train is connected to the front of Car y;just before this query, Car x and Car y belong to different connected components. 2 x y: Disconnect the front of Car y from the rear of Car x. It is guaranteed that:x \neq y;just before this query, the front of Car y is directly connected to the rear of Car x.   3 x: Print the car numbers of the cars belonging to the connected component containing Car x, from front to back.  
2 \leq N \leq 10^5 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5 1 \leq x \leq N 1 \leq y \leq N All values in input are integers. All queries satisfy the conditions in the Problem Statement. The queries of the format 3 x ask to print at most 10^6 car numbers in total.
