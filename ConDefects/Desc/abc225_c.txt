There is a 10^{100} \times 7 matrix A, where the (i,j)-th entry is (i-1) \times 7 + j for every pair of integers (i,j)\ (1 \leq i \leq 10^{100}, 1 \leq j \leq 7). Given an N \times M matrix B, determine whether B is some (unrotated) rectangular part of A. 
1 \leq N \leq 10^4 1 \leq M \leq 7 1 \leq B_{i,j} \leq 10^9 All values in input are integers.
