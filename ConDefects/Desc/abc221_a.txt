The magnitude of an earthquake is a logarithmic scale of the energy released by the earthquake.  It is known that each time the magnitude increases by 1, the amount of energy gets multiplied by approximately 32. Here, we assume that the amount of energy gets multiplied by exactly 32 each time the magnitude increases by 1.  In this case, how many times is the amount of energy of a magnitude A earthquake as much as that of a magnitude B earthquake?
3\leq B\leq A\leq 9 A and B are integers.
